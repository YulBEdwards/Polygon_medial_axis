This example application calculates the medial axis skeleton of a simple polygon. A medial axis consists of lines and (possibly) parabolic arcs in the interior of the polygon where each point of the skeleton is equidistant from the two polygon edges closest to the point. The medial axis is not the same as a straight (or roof line) skeleton of a polygon. A number of test datasets are provided the test.zip file. The application plots results in an svg file. It is assumed that an application for rendering svg data (such as Firefox, or Edge) is available.

The application is implemented in Lazarus to make the example useful in the widest possible number of different computer platforms. Because of the similarity of Lazarus to C#, translation to the C# language is relatively straightforward.
